# Cyclic Nexus  
**Version 2 of the Cyclic Lite mod (built from scratch!)**

- **Link to the original Cyclic Lite (v1) repo**: [GitHub - Cyclic Lite](https://github.com/zipCoder933/Cyclic-Lite)  
- **A mod designed specifically for the Nexus Beyond modpack**: [Nexus Beyond on CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/nexus-beyond)  

## Purpose  
This version was created to address the excessive, unnecessary content in the original Cyclic mod. The bulk of unused features made it inefficient for my needs, so I decided to develop a custom mod from scratch.
